	<p1>Prologue: Dreams that come true <br>
			<br>
			The story starts like this. <br>
			An ordinary college student is attending class like he ordinarily does. <br>
			The job of a student is to study, so attending class is a given. <br>
			He's listening to the lecture and taking notes when something starts taking a strange turn. <br>
			But the problem doesn't really show itself to anybody accept for the one that noticed it. <br>
			What's happening isn't really something that is messing with the lives of anybody present nor will it bring danger or harm to the person who noticed it. <br>
			It's simple really. <br>
			While listening to a lecture during class at a random moment this ordinary college student begins to remember everything that is going to happen from his point of view. <br>
			Like if he had seen the future. <br>
			The girl sitting next to him sighs, the guy in front to the left of him drops his pencil, the guy to his right is watching the replay of last night's football game, and the words coming out of the professors mouth or words that he had already heard. <br>
			Noticing what was happening, he looks down at his notes and thinks about how weird it was that he remembers this. And then the last of the events is him seeing the drawings on his notebook and he remembers this whole series of events. <br>
			Like a replay of some kind. <br>
			Like if he was playing a game and died so had to go through the same tasks again in the story arc. <br>
			Like rewatching a movie. <br>
			He just lived the events he had experienced in his dream a month before. <br>
			"Woah" He said. <br>
